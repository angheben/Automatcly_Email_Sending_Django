The idea of this project it's to simulate an iteration between the user and an automatic email sending, where the user needs to fill some fields and when he send the message, the system automatic send him an email confirming that his message has been sent

For this project I've used SQLite3 as a database, Django for Backend and HTML, CSS and JS for Frontend

Futhermore, in this project I've used the Framework Bootstrap in my HTML templates creating a very nice template
